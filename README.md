# vending_machine
This Verilog-based VLSI project designs a vending machine using a finite state machine (FSM) to handle coin inputs (10, 20, 50 units). The machine dispenses a product once the required amount is reached and returns change for excess. It demonstrates efficient state transitions and practical digital logic design.
